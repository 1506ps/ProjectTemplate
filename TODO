(1) Need to deal with empty directories in inst/ not going into git.

(2) Integrate log4r and automate its loading.

(3) Need to create a update.project() function that provides a way to merge new defaults into an existing project generated using an earlier version of ProjectTemplate.

(4) Consider renaming run.tests() to test.project() for consistency across names.

(5) Fix bug in tests caused by cat() calls in lib/boot.R
