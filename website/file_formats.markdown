# File Formats

ProjectTemplate can automatically load a variety of text based file formats, including comma separated value (CSV) files, tab separated value (TSV) files and generic whitespace separated value (WSV) files. In addition, automatic data loading is supported for several binary file formats, including the RData, SPSS and Stata formats.

Beyond those file formats, several ad hoc file types support the loading of data sets that are accessible over HTTP or contained in SQL databases, such as MySQL and sqlite.

Please note that the Stata file format has not been tested yet. Because ProjectTemplate is simply wrapping the 'foreign' package, it is expected to work, but we have not confirmed that yet. Your mileage may vary.

# Ad Hoc File Types

## URL Files
You can access CSV files over HTTP using the `.url` file extension. Inside
of the `.url` file, you must place YAML that describes your data sources.
An example file is shown below.

    url: "http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/ProjectTemplate/sample_data.csv"

## SQL Files
You can access database stored in a MySQL database using the `.sql` file
extension. Inside of the `.sql` file, you must place YAML that describes
the connection protocol for your database. An example file is shown below.

    type: mysql
    user: sample_user
    password: sample_password
    host: localhost
    dbname: sample_database
    table: sample_table
